## The tittle of my project will most likely be the themed worldle game
## My  final projecr is  a themed wordle game. You will be able to pick a theme and pick the level of difficulty for the wordle.
## My project will utilize the use of dictinaries if statements and a series of functions to execute the different levels and themes of the game. The game will be executed by having the user pick a theme, having them pick a difficulty level and then having the user guess what word they have based off this. The user has a limited number of tries and the game alerts the user when they guess the correct letter in the word or the correct order. IT also alerts the user if the letter they have typed is completely wrong.
## Im not planning to execute this project towards another class.
## I dont plan on collaboarting with any classmates
## I  will accomplish the user being able to pick the difficulty level and the theme for the wordle game.
## I do think my overall plans for the project will be able to be accomplished. I will have a game where the user is able to type in their guesses and be given an answer based off of their response.
## I hope to at least accomplish having a wordle game where the user is asked about the theme they would live and the level of difficulty
## I will need to figure out how to program a letter being in the right or wrong position and having the user know both. I will also need to figure out how the different colors of wordle(red,green or gray) will be incorporated into the game based off the users response. Making sure there are no work arounds for the game or no errors when the user types something in is something I'll need to figure out.
